# CleaningDataR_course
<h4>A submission repository for the course project of the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course in R</h4>


This repository contains an R script "run_analysis.R", this README, and the code book.

When the Samsung data in placed in your R working directory with its default direcoty name "UCI HAR Dataset", running the script run_analysis.R will produce a data frame, "TidyTable".

A description of the cleaning process, the variables in TidyTable and other such information is included in the code book "codebook.md".

For a comprehensive description of the source metadata not relevant to the TidyTable output the reader is referred to the features_info.txt file included in the UCI HAR Dataset directory.
